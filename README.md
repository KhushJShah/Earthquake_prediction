# README: Earthquake Prediction Using Magnetic Anomaly Data

## Overview

This project explores the use of magnetic anomaly data to predict earthquake occurrences in Japan, utilizing datasets such as EMAG2v3 and various machine learning algorithms. The study aims to enhance earthquake prediction models by integrating geospatial analysis with advanced data modeling techniques.

## Introduction

Earthquakes are significant natural phenomena caused by the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, often occurring along tectonic plate boundaries. This project investigates the potential of using magnetic anomalies, recorded by datasets like EMAG2v3, to predict earthquakes. The Richter scale quantifies earthquake magnitude, while seismographs detect seismic waves, providing critical data for analysis.

## Datasets Description

### EMAG2v3 Dataset

The EMAG2v3 dataset offers a high-resolution global map of magnetic anomalies at a 2-arc-minute resolution. Key columns include:
- **Longitude and Latitude**: Geographic coordinates.
- **SeaLevel**: Magnetic anomaly values at sea level.
- **UpCont**: Magnetic anomaly values at 4km altitude.
- **Code**: Geographic region identifier (Code 25 for Japan).
- **Error**: Measurement error estimate.

### Interpolated Dataset

An additional dataset was generated by interpolating anomalous values to create a finer temporal resolution from January 2017 to December 2024, focusing on Japan. The dataset includes fields for latitude, longitude, sea level magnetic anomaly values, earthquake occurrences (0 or 1), and corresponding dates.

## Previous Work

### Longmenshan Fault Zone (LFZ)

The LFZ in China is characterized by complex tectonic interactions and significant magnetic anomalies indicative of deep-seated magmatic activities. For more information, see [LFZ Study](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/48/3/278/580291/Fading-magnetic-anomalies-thermal-structure-and).

### Japanese Data Collection

Magnetic anomaly studies in the Japan Trench have been crucial for understanding subduction dynamics and earthquake mechanisms. Learn more at [Japan Trench Source](https://earthref.org/ERDA/970/).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved visualizing magnetic anomaly distributions and earthquake occurrences using ArcGIS. The map developed highlights clusters of seismic activity in Japan for 2017, revealing potential correlations between anomalies and earthquakes.

## Modeling

Three machine learning algorithms were applied:
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Achieved an accuracy of 0.11 due to dataset size limitations.
- **Logistic Regression**: Achieved perfect accuracy (1) by effectively classifying earthquake occurrences.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Also achieved perfect accuracy (1), demonstrating robust classification capabilities.

## Results

The results indicate that while LOF struggled with the small dataset size, Logistic Regression and SVM effectively utilized available data for accurate earthquake prediction.

## Future Work

- **Expand Dataset**: Collect a larger dataset spanning multiple years to enhance the robustness of time-series analysis and improve model accuracy.
  
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Implement advanced time-series models to capture temporal patterns and predict future earthquake occurrences more effectively.

- **Anomaly Detection**: Explore more sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms, such as Deep Learning-based approaches, to identify subtle patterns in magnetic anomalies.

- **Feature Expansion**: Incorporate additional features from the Chinese Longmenshan Fault Zone paper, such as Curie Point Depth (CPD), heat flow measurements, and rock type susceptibility, to enrich the dataset.
